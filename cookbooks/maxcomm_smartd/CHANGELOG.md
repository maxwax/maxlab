# maxcomm_smartd CHANGELOG

# 1.1.0

* After deploying smartd, tag the node with 'smartd' so we know its monitored.

# 1.0.0

Initial release.

* Used this cookbook to simulate a 'community' cookbook.  It still has some commented out debug statements left in the code so that I can enable them in the future if I see things that don't look right.

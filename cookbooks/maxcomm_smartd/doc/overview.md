This cookbook deploys smartmontools including the smartd daemon.

It configures and enables smartd to monitor storage devices' S.M.A.R.T. health attributes and alert on failure indicating values.

This cookbook simulates a community cookbook and in my lab I use the 'mylab_smartd' wrapper cookbook to customize it for my home lab, 'maxlab'.
